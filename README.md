### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<table>
      
        <tr>
            <td>Calories</td>
            <td><b>277kcal</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Carbs</td>
            <td><b>0g</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Protein</td>
            <td><b>20g</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Fat</td>
            <td><b>22g</b></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning about accessibility and responsive design in order to make my website more user friendly for all users. Additionally, I want focus on learning javascript and go deep in it. I have to even understand the few concepts of CSS would really love to go much deeper into it. Leanrning and exploring tailwind will gonna be a fun part.
I had problem while making this project, I didn't know about how to make it  responsive and adaptable for different screen sizes. So it took me some time to learn. 


### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - A comprehensive guide to web development.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Another great resource for learning web development.
